## 10/22/2025 - Preliminary Research  

I started off by basically just doing a lot of browsing to try and find out what I want to make.
The closest printer I found to what I want to build would be the [Salad Fork](https://github.com/PrintersForAnts/Salad_Fork?tab=readme-ov-file) by [3DPrintersforAnts](https://3dprintersforants.com/). It's basically a shrunk down Voron Trident.

I'm definitely using 2020 extrusions instead of the 1515 used here though.

Pandora's Box (also by 3DPforAnts) looked very interesting, and I would love to attempt to build something like that, but having a belted z-xis would be too complicated, so I'll just stick to leadscrews for my first build. Speaking of the z-axis, I was considering of using one motor for all three leadscrews and using a timing belt like the X1C and the [Anicept Vex](https://github.com/invictus-anic3tus/anicept-vex/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file) use because it's cheaper, but after asking around and looking at other printers I realized that z-tilt is too valuable to sacrifice. Oh and @Renovic on the HC slack provided an extremely helpful explanation comparing the different types of z-axis setups for fixed gantries:

> Motion type
Leadscrew
Sometimes can lead to z wobble
Integrated leadscrew are usually better since some couplers are a bit springy
Usually the simplest option
Look at trident
Belts
You almost always need a gear reduction
using a 60t and 16/20t pulley with 188t belt is common
Some use nema 17 planetary gearboxes but its sometimes expesive and usually has backlash
Highest gear reduction is worm, but thats also somewhat expensive
If its a really small printer(like v0 or slightly larger) you can get away with a 16t pulley or using bmg gears for a reduction
Look at 2.4 z drive or k3 z
Number of z motors/points
Triple Z
Pretty common because 3 points define a plane and allows for bed tramming with 3 motors
You can do 3 leadscrews without 3 seperate motors by using a timing belt to link them together, this is better than controlling a multiple steppers with the same driver
Double Z
Can be worse that triple Z, but its often better for packaging and usually used with linear rods on Z
Single Z
Only really used for small beds, you need to make the bed carriage really stiff for the bed to not bend or bounce



  

## 11/3/2025 - Still More Research   

I mostly did toolhead research. I've decided I'll use the Xol Carriage from the Xol Toolhead, as well as the A4T toolhead, both of which seem really good. I did some research regarding on how to mount the belts to the carriage, and yeah the Archetype clips seem to be the best. For custom toolhead carriages, it's recommend to wrap the belts around some pins, and then make sure 3-4 teeth interlock. Seems to be the most painless way of doing it. I've decided I'm going to use a 20150 axial fan and two 4010 blower fans. That way, if my toolhead sucks (which it probably will), I can reuse the parts to make an A4T or Xol (another reason to use the Xol carriage). I'm also going to use the TZ 2.0 V6 hotend, as it's cheap and decent. I spent a lot of time trying to understand different toolheads and their creator's design choices. But I've now decided, after almost two days of research and browsing that I'll like place the A4T toolhead in the assembly, design the gantry, frame, and everything to that, and then finally make a placeholder/basic toolhead. Toolheads are difficult to make, but can easily be replaced with existing designs. Gantries, frames, and everything else not so much.
